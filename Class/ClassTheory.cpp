//  A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data (called properties)
//  and functions (called methods) that an object will have.


//  Class defines the structure.
//  Object is created from the class.
//  public allows properties and methods to be accessed outside the class.


//   Create an object of "AboutMe", specify the class name, followed by the object name.

//    To access the class attributes (name,age,...), use the dot syntax (.) on the object:



// In C++, an object is created from a class
